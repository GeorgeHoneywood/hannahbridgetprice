      Writer, reader, wannabe author.
    
      &nbsp;

      {{< justify >}} 
      Growing up in Cornwall, I always dreamt of being an author one day; of
      plucking one of the many stories from my head and getting it all down on
      paper for someone else to read.
      I was even voted â€˜most likely to write a novelâ€™ in my yearbook!
      In 2023, after graduating with a degree in Computer Science from Royal Holloway, I
      began to make that dream a reality.
      I now reside in London with my twin sister, my fiancÃ©, and our two cats.
      Any time Iâ€™m not working my 9:00 - 18:00 big-girl-job in fashion, reading, cooking, or out and about, Iâ€™ll be writing.
      Stay tuned for short stories, publishing news (whether that be self or traditional!), and other updates ðŸ˜Š
