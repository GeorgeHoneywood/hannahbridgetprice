100 years ago, the demons fell off the face of the world. These were not monsters from the depths, or from the stars--they wore human faces, appearing in the night, plundering every country in their path. Unstoppable, until they weren't.
But not every scar heals.
At a university on the edge of everything, four young students from every corner of this fractured world come together. Each has their reason to be there--and a reason they wish they weren't. But they find themselves united in their common goals: to prove themselves, and to find where they belong. Over the course of the year, their commitment to these goals, and one another, will be tested.
The threads of fate are unpredictable. By the year's end the final remnant of the empire shall fall, but will our heroes survive the consequences of their choices, or be pulled down by the tangle of their intertwining lives?

A brutal (international) high fantasy about colonialism, unlikely friendship, and strength in diversity. Featuring friends-to-lovers, found family, high stakes, no clear-cut villain, academia, and a diverse, well defined magic system.
