In the Kingdom of Rydhses, everyone knows their place: the Wedhen in the baobab trees; the Dowra on the waters; the Leur under the earth. With prophecies available for little coin, no crime can be undiscovered, no day can be unpredictable, your life is in the hands of the gods. Until it's discovered, in a year's time, the prophecies are no more.
For 21 years Vanna knew her role in the story: sorcerer, researcher, and unquestioning daughter to the Divine Ruler. But when she awakens to find herself alone in its pages, the future unwritten and the realm seemingly in her hands, she must venture to the world below for answers.
Unlikely friends, ever-changing enemies, and a world that has already ended... how can she save her people from themselves?

A whimsical (non-Western) high fantasy about the end of the world. Featuring friendship, romance, high stakes, no clear-cut villain, BIPOC rep and a well defined magic system.
