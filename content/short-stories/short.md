### Introduction

This is a very short story that I wrote for a writing class back in November 2023. Iâ€™ve edited it after a year of writing experience, and was pleased to see how my writing has already improved! I might revisit this each year to see how my writing has changed ðŸ˜Š
The goal of the piece was to fully immerse yourself in a placeâ€”in this case, a train. What do you feel, see, hear, taste? I put myself on a train back home to Cornwall.

### Story

A sudden jolt brings me back to my senses. The stale taste in my mouth is the first of those senses to welcome me back to the waking world. A god awful crick in the neck is the second.
