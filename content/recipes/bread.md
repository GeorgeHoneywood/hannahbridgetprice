A classic. No need to buy bread ever again (unless it's a different kind).
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
### Ingredients
* 300ml warm water
* 1 tsp sugar
* 2 tsp salt
* 500g bread flour
* 2 tsp yeast
* Oil
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
### Method
1. Put everything in the bread machine in that order. Mix the salt and the sugar in the water before adding in the flour.
2. This is roughly a 2lb loaf on my machine. Customise your crust settings and whatnot!
