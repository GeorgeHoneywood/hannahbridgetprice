I have tried and tested many a vegan chilli, and this has always remained the best. A great recipe for meat eaters who say they hate tofu ;)
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
### Ingredients
#### For Tofu
* 400g firm, pressed tofu
* 1.5 tbsp oil
* 4.5 tbsp soy sauce
* 2.25 tsp chilli powder
* 2.25 tsp garlic powder
* 1.5 tsp cumin
* 3/4 tsp cayenne pepper
* 3/4 tsp black pepper
#### For Chilli
* Onion
* 4-6 garlic cloves
* Chillies/chilli flakes (optional)
* 1.5 tbsp chilli powder
* 2 tsp cumin
* 1 tsp paprika
* 1-2 veg stock cubes
* Black beans
* Pinto beans
* Kidney beans in chilli sauce
* 1 cup of whatever vegetable (like one pepper, one can of sweetcorn etc. use what you have!)
* Can of chopped tomatoes
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
### Method
1. Turn on fan oven to 180 degrees.
2. Crumble tofu onto baking tray.
3. Add oil, soy sauce and spices and mush/stir it into the tofu well, ensuring it's all coated.
4. Put in oven for 30-40 minutes, taking and out and stirring every 10.
5. Fry onion.
6. Add garlic and chillies.
7. Add your veggie(s) of choice.
7. Add in all your spices and crumbled veg stock cube(s).
8. Add in your beans, 2 cups (roughly 500ml) boiling water and chopped tomatoes.
9. Simmer for 30 minutes (without lid).
10. Add tofu and simmer for another 5 minutes.
11. Serve and enjoy!

### Additional notes
* I use Oxo stock cubes, which are 1 per 190 ml. Take this into consideration.
* Kidney beans WITH chilli sauce isn't necessary but bulks it up.
* I don't know what to do if you don't have a fan oven.
* If your tofu looks burnt, stir it and you'll probably realise it isn't.
