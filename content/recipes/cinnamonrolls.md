My first ever bread maker recipe! From Go Dairy Free.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
### Ingredients
* 3/4 cup + 2 tbsp warm water
* 2 tbsp oil/margarine (flavourless)
* 2.5 cups bread flour
* 1/4 cup white sugar
* 1 tsp yeast*
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/3 cup brown sugar
* 2 tsp ground cinnamon
* 2 tbsp margarine
* 1 cup icing sugar
* 1-2 tbsp plant milk
* 1/2 tsp vanilla extract (optional)
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
### Method
1. Put the first 6 ingredients (up to and including the salt) in your bread maker (in that order) on the dough setting.
2. Mix together your brown sugar and cinnamon and melt your margarine. 
3. Roll your dough into a rectangle (9x11 inches) on a lightly floured surface.
4. Spread the margarine and sprinkle your cinnamon sugar all over.
5. From one of the short sides, roll your dough.
6. Cut into roughly 9 pieces.
7. Place into a greased baking dish/tray. Leave in a warm place for an hour, or the fridge overnight.
8. Bake for 20 mins at 190 degrees.
9. Meanwhile, mix your icing sugar, milk, and vanilla in a bowl. When everything's done, pour it evenly on the top!

### Additional notes
