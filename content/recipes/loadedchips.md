### Ingredients
* 800g jackgruit in water (2 cans)
* 3 tbsp oil
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp pepper
* 1/2 tsp sugar
* 2 tsp oregano
* 2 tsp sage

* 1/2 tsp thyme
* Gravy granules
* 2 servings of oven chips
&nbsp;

### Method
1. Toss jackfruit onto a baking tray and coat in seasonings and oil. Use your hands to ensure it's well covered.
2. Bake for 20 minutes at 200 degrees celsius.
3. Take out of oven and stir. Put back in for another 20 minutes (check you chips, you can add them in now too).
4. Make your gravy. For more flavour, I add onion and garlic granules to mine!
5. Remove from oven. Tear jackfruit with a fork.
6. Serve chips. Load on jackfruit and gravy!
