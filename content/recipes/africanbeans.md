After a trip to South Africa to see family, I came back with a desire to find the recipe for some of the best beans I have ever eaten; sadly, I didn't find it, but I did find these, which are a close second.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
### Ingredients
* Onion
* 1 tsp paprika
* 1 tsp brown sugar
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp chilli powder
* 1/4 tsp cumin
* Pinch of black pepper
* 70g tomato paste
* 200g coconut cream
* 1 can of cannelloni beans
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
### Method
1. Fry onion until soft.
2. Add seasonings.
3. Add tomato paste and cream.
4. Add beans and simmer for 15 minutes.
5. Serve with polenta/nshima.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
### Additional notes
* Traditionally this would be eaten with your hands.
