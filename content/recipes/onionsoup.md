Our questionably French Onion soup recipe, inspired by [BBC Good Food](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/french-onion-soup). We usually have it with some sort of bread or croutons, but some nice vegan cheese would work well too.
&nbsp;

### Ingredients
* 1 kg brown onions
* 3 tbsp oil
* 1 tsp sugar
* 5 cloves of garlic
* 2 tbsp flour
* 300 ml wine, or wine stock pot
* 1.2 l of beef stock (we use 2 OXO Vegan Beef cubes)
* ~2 tbsp yeast extract (e.g. Marmite)
* ~2 tbsp beef-flavour gravy granules
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
### Method
1. Slice up onions, place in large saucepan with the oil. Fry until soft (10 mins).
2. Add the sugar, and fry with the lid off until the onions start to caramelise. If they start to burn, add a little water and continue. When nearly done, add the garlic.
3. Add the flour and mix. Add the wine and beef stock. Simmer with or without the lid to adjust consistency.
4. Mix in the yeast extract and gravy granules to taste. The yeast extract will add a beefy flavour. The gravy granules will thicken the soup.
5. Continue simmering for 15 mins, or until you reach the desired consistency.
