During my recent trip to Cambodia, I had the privilege of being taught some traditional Khmer cuisine. Lok lak was something that I loved, and so the first thing I wanted to do when I got back was try making my own! 
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
### Ingredients
* 450g tofu
* Cornflour
* 4 tbsp soy sauce
* 2 tbsp ketchup
* 2.5 tbsp sugar
* 1/2 tsp MSG (optional)
* 3 tbsp rice wine vinegar
* 6 garlic cloves
* Thumb sized piece of ginger
* 1 red chilli
* 1 tbsp kampot pepper (ground)
* Onion (sliced)
* 2 tomatoes
* 2 limes
* Rice
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
### Method
1. Chop your tofu, coat in cornflour and then fry. *
2. Meanwhile, put your soy sauce, ketchup, sugar, MSG and vinegar in a jug and mix together.
3. Also meanwhile, blend together your garlic, ginger and chilli with a little bit of water to make a paste.
4. When your tofu is done, set aside and start frying your onion.
5. When the onion is soft, add in your garlic and ginger 'paste' and your pepper. Fry for a minute.
6. Add in your sauce and heat until it bubbles. Then toss in and coat your tofu.
7. Serve with rice, sliced tomato and squeeze on the lime.

### Additional notes
* *Don't disturb the tofu while it's frying. You want to wait till it's browning and then turn it over. Also I recommend put your tofu and cornflour in a tub and shaking it.
