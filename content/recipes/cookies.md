Can't go wrong with a chocolate chip cookie.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
### Ingredients
* 225g oats
* 125g plain flour
* 1 tsp bicard
* Pinch of salt
* 125 vegan butter
* 100g brown sugar

* 2 tbsp golden sugar
* 2 tsp vanilla extract
* 2 tbsp plant milk
* 200g vegan chocolate chips
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
### Method
1. Blend up your oats until it's more like a flour (but not completely).
2. Mix it with your flour, bicard and salt.
3. In another bowl, mix together your butter and sugars until soft and airy.
4. Mix everything together with your chocolate chips.
5. Put round dollops of the dough onto a baking tray.
6. Bake for 12-15 minutes at 160 degrees.

### Additional notes
* If you can't find vegan chocolate chips, just break up a dark chocolate bar.
* If you don't have brown sugar, mix black treacle with white sugar.
