Whilst in Vietnam we ate a lot of clay pot aubergines, and this recipe is a good recreation. For bonus points it is also nice and simple. Credits to [golden tiffin](https://goldentiffin.co/blog/2018/1/13/vietnamese-caramelised-aubergines) for the original recipe.

&nbsp;
### Ingredients

* 2 big or 3 smaller aubergines
* Oil for frying
* 4 tbsp soy sauce
* 4 tsp sugar
* 2 tsp paprika (preferably smoked)
* 1 tbsp sriracha
* 1 tsp pepper
* 8 spring onions
* Rice to serve
&nbsp;

### Method

1. Slice the aubergines into 2 cm thick slices, then fry/grill/bake until very soft and well browned. This will take quite a long time -- 20 minutes or so. If frying, put a good layer of oil in the pan, or if grilling/baking, brush the oil on to both sides.
2. Once the aubergines are soft, cut them up into bite-sized pieces, and return them to the pan.
3. Add the soy sauce, sugar, paprika, sriracha, pepper and spring onions, and stir continuously until the mixture takes on a gooey consistency.
4. Serve with rice.
