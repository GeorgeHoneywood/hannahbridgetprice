A Tuscan dish that I wasn't really sure what it'd turn out like: it turned out good! And easy. A great combo.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
### Ingredients
* 400g vegan sausage (any)
* 250g baby potatoes
* 2 - 3 tbsp nurtitional yeast
* 0.5 tsp oregano
* 4 cloves garlic
* 1 - 2 shallots
* 2.5 - 3 cups water
* 2 beef stock cubes
* 2 bay leaves
* 3 - 5 large handfuls spinach
* 60g cashews + 1 cup water
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
### Method
1. Soak your cashews in the water.
2. Put all other ingredients (minus spinach) into the slow cooker on high for 3+ hours.
3. If desired, you can either slow cook your sausages (for a more hot dog like texture) or fry and add at the end.
4. When nearly done, blend the cashews in the water and add, alongside the spinach.
5. Cook until it wilts.
