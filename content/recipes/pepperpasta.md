There are people who like pepper, and then there are people who love pepper. This one's for you.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
### Ingredients
* 400g gnocchi
* 1.5 tsp crushed peppercorns
* 4 tbsp white wine
* 1 stock cube
* 1/4 tsp garlic powder
* 4 tbsp water
* 1 cup (around 250ml) soy single cream
* Salt and pepper to taste
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
### Method
1. Fry your gnocchi until crispy (see notes).
2. Remove gnocchi from pan and fry your peppercorns in your wine until the wine is gone.
3. Add in the rest of your ingredients and fry for about 5 minutes until thick. Then toss in and coat your gnocchi.

### Additional notes
* I use oxo stock cubes, adjust this measurement if you use a stronger one (or just add some salt)
* Add more black pepper to taste
* You can boil your gnocchi, but frying them is tasty!
