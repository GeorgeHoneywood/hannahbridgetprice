A quick and easy lentil dahl, which easily tops many which are more complicated.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
### Ingredients
* Onion
* 6 garlic cloves
* Chilli

* 4 tsp curry powder
* 1 tsp turmeric

* A can of coconut milk
* 1/2 cup red lentils
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
### Method
1. Fry your onion, garlic and chilli until soft.

### Additional notes
* I use oxo cubes which are 1 per 190 ml, take this into consideration.
* If you don't like heat, omit the chilli and use mild chilli powder but don't skimp on it as there's more to chilli powder than heat!
