A simply, classic recipe to warm your bones.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

* Stock cube
* 1/2 tsp paprika
* 1 tbsp worcester sauce
* 2+ tbsp sriracha
* 1 can chopped tomatoes
* 1 can baked beans
* Fresh parsley
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
### Method
1. Bake your sausages.
2. Meanwhile, fry your onion.

&nbsp;

### Additional notes
* I like to use Richmond's vegan sausages.
* With the addition of sriracha, I find the quality of the beans doesn't matter.
* Most worcester sauce is not vegan. Beware.
* I use Oxo stock cubes which are 1 per 190ml, take this into consideration.
