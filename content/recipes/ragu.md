This umami ragu is flat out one of the best things I have ever eaten; that's not something to be taken lightly.

2. Put veg into a baking dish with your oil, miso, harissa, soy sauce, tomato paste and cumin seeds and mix well.
3. Bake at 190 degrees (fan) for 40 minutes.
3. Stir halfway.
4. When done, add in your lentils, pearl barley, red wine, creamed coconut, stock cubes and water and mix well.

### Additional notes
* If you only have red wine, but not red wine stock pots, use it and use less water.
* I use Blue Dragon's creamed coconut, if you only have coconut cream, use less water.
