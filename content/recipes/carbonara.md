It's hard to go wrong with an eggy pasta dish with vegan bacon.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
### Ingredients
* 120g cashews (soaked)
* 1/2 cup nutritional yeast
* 1/2 tsp turmeric
* 2 tsp English mustard
* 3/4 tsp garlic powder
* 3/4 tsp onion granules
* 1 tsp black salt
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 1/4 cup plant milk
* Vegan bacon bits
* Spaghetti
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
### Method
1. Soak your cashews for 2+ hours.
2. Blend your ingredients other than your spaghetti and bacon bits.
3. Meanwhile cook your spaghetti.
4. Mix together and top with bacon pieces and fresh parsley.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
### Additional notes
* I recommed vivera's bacon bits.
* If you've never tried black salt, I highly recommend it for that eggy taste.
