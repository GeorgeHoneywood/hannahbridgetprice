A quick, easy, tasty dessert for one! From Loving It Vegan.

### Ingredients

* 2 tbsp cocoa powder
* 3 tbsp white sugar
* 1/4 tsp baking powder
* 4 tbsp plant milk
* 2 tbsp flavourless oil/margarine
* 1/4 - 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
* Chocolate chips
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
### Method
1. Mix everything well in a large mug/small bowl.
2. Microwave at roughly 900W for 90 seconds.

### Additional notes
* It is better underdone than overdone.
* Chocolate chips can just be broken up chocolate. I highly recommend adding it!
