This is a slow cooker tofu butter curry that is stupidly quick to prepare and also stupidly delicious and creamy.

### Ingredients
* 4 diced shallots
* 1 can coconut milk
* 170g tomato paste
* 3.5 tsp garam masala
* 1 tsp ginger
* 1 tsp curry powder
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp chilli powder
* 1/2 tsp black pepper
* 1/2 tsp dried fenugreek leaves
* 1/2 tsp chilli flakes (optional)
* 450g tofu (we like the smokey toofoo blocks)
* 3 tsp lime juice 
* 1 tsp brown sugar (optional)

### Method
1. Turn on your slow cooker to medium and let it warm up.
2. Add all your ingredients bar your tofu, sugar and lime into the slow cooker pot. Whisk until mixed.
3. Tear your tofu into cube, bite sized pieces and toss in.
4. Leave with the lid on for 5-6 hours.
5. Add lime juice and sugar at the end.

### Additional notes
* We ended up using shallots for this recipe, but you can easily use one large onion.
