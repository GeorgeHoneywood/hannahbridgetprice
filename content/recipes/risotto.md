This is the risotto that made my risotto-hating partner realise they like risotto.

### Ingredients
* Vegan butter
* Onion
* 4 garlic cloves
* 1 cup risotto rice
* 4.5 cups veg broth
* 1 bunch asparagus.
* 1-2 tbsp lemon juice
#### Parmesan
* Cashews
* Nutritional yeast
* Salt
* Garlic powder
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
### Method
1. Fry onion 4-5 mins.
2. Add garlic and rice. Stir until toasted.
3. Deglaze with white wine.
4. Add the broth, not all at once. 0.75 cups at a time, until the rice has absorbed it. Stir constantly.
5. Add asparagus towards the end.
6. Top with 'parmesan', butter, and lemon juice.
7. Season to taste.

### Additional notes
* I use Oxo cubes, which is one per 190ml. Take this into consideration.
