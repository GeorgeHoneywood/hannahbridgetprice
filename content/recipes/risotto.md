This is the risotto that made my risotto-hating partner realise they like risotto.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
### Ingredients
* Shallot
* 4 garlic cloves
* 100g mushrooms
* 1 or 2 veg stock cubes
* 1/2 cup risotto rice
* 2 cups water
* 2 tsp white wine vinegar
* 4 tbsp nutritional yeast
* Fresh parsley
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
### Method
1. Fry shallot and garlic.
2. Toss in the mushrooms. 
3. Stir in the rice, vinegar and veg stock cubes, and add one ladle of water.
4. When the rice has absorbed the water, add another ladle. Repeat for about 30 minutes. 
5. Once cooked, toss in the nutritional yeast and fresh parsley and season to taste.
&nbsp;

### Additional notes
* I use oxo cubes, which is one per 190ml. Take this into consideration.
