After spending a long time looking for the perfect spag bol, I felt defeated. It was only after I had a roast dinner, I thought to myself "everything really is better roasted". While roasted tomatoes are not a new concept with regards to spag bol, it was to me. So here it is, the first recipe I came up with entirely myself! Enjoy :)
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
### Ingredients
* 6 regular tomatoes
* 350g cherry tomatoes
* Garlic bulb
* Thyme
* Oregano
* Salt
* Onion
* Veg stock cube
* Red wine stock pot (or another regular veg one)
* 2 tsp italian herbs
* 1/2 tsp paprika
* 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
* 200-250g vegan mince
* 1 cup water
* 1 tbsp tomato puree
* 2 tbsp nutritional yeast
* 1/2 tsp sugar
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
### Method
1. Chop your tomatoes on half and cut the bottom off the garlic and place on a baking tray.
2. Coat in oil and sprinkle on oregano, thyme and salt.
3. Roast for 30-40 minutes 180 degrees.
4. Fry onion.
5. Add seasonings.
6. Add your mince.
7. Add in the roasted tomatoes and garlic, and water, puree, nutritional yeast and sugar.
8. Simmer for 20 mins then remove the lid for another 10.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
### Additional notes
* Simmer longer without the lid if it is liquidy.
* If you've cut the end of the garlic you should be able to squeeze it out easily.
